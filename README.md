# ISAT-Textbox-Generator
Inspired by the UT/DR textbox creator, here's a hastily made tool to do the same for ISAT! If you somehow stumble on this before I post about it, it won't work unless you move the icon under www/icon into the same directory and rename it isat.ico. This will be polished a lot more in a week though.

As the face images aren't public, you'll have to own the game to use this tool. On first startup, you'll be propmted to find the game's /faces directory.

To have the font correctly displayed in text boxes, you'll need to double click "VCR_OSD_MONO_1.001.ttf" and choose to install it. THIS ONLY WILL WORK ON WINDOWS
